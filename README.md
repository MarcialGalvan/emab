Eye movement as Biomarker for early detection Autistic Spectrum Disorders

Early and objective detection of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a challenge in actual neuroscience, and it is important in order to offer the right treatment to the patients at early ages.

The diagnosis of people with ASD is made by the use of behavioral exams and questionnaires that require considerable time and expertise on the side clinicians and parents, so is biased by the evaluator. There are some standardized tests, as the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ test) [S. Baron Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001], that allows a classification of the autism degree, but it has limitations in the application. Otherwise, those test are easily falsifiable by the subjects, and can ÃÅt be applied to infants.

In order to obtain an objective detection of autism, my research group, Neurochemistry and Neuroimaging Laboratory, University of La Laguna, is trying two ways. The first one is biological: the use of Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of the brain (fMRS), in the search of metabolite markers. The second is the use of the gaze exploration patterns as indicator of the autism presence: People with autism has a different relation with the world, and it has a reflection in how they explore images.
This second approach is the one we use in this project.
